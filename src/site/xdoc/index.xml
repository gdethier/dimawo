	<section name="Introduction">
	
		<p>DiMaWo framework eases the development of distributed
		applications based on a Master/Worker architecture as well as highly
		parallel applications. The framework provides common services
		(broadcasting, leader election, etc.) that are implemented in a mostly
		decentralized way, solving robustness and scalability problems generally
		related to classical master/worker architecture implementations.</p>

		<p>DiMaWo was initially developed at University of Liege, Belgium,
		and is used by
		<a href="http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~dethier/labogrid/">LaBoGrid
		</a>, a distributed Lattice Boltzmann-based
		flow simulation tool. The theory underlying DiMaWo is described
		in details in following thesis:</p>
