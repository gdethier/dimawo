<p>The DiMaWo framework eases the development of distributed applications based
on a Master/Worker architecture. The framework provides common services
(broadcasting, leader election, etc.) that are implemented in a mostly
decentralized way.</p>

<p>DiMaWo applications are composed of agents interacting in an asynchronous
way. The user must at least provide 2 types of agents:
the {@link be.ulg.montefiore.dimawo.WorkerAgent Worker Agent} (WA) and
the {@link be.ulg.montefiore.dimawo.MasterAgent Master Agent} (MA).
He does so through a specific implementation
of {@link be.ulg.montefiore.dimawo.MasterWorkerFactory Master/Worker Factory
interface}. The WA implements the workers of the application
and the MA the master. DiMaWo provides generic "executable" (i.e defining
a static main method) classes that can be used to easily deploy a DiMaWo
application (see {@link be.ulg.montefiore.dimawo.exec exec} package).</p>

<p>In addition to user provided agents, a DiMaWo application implies several core
agents:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Communicator (COM) implements a simple message passing interface
	based on Java objects serialization (see
	{@link be.ulg.montefiore.dimawo.middleware.communication communication} package).</li>
	<li>The Overlay Agent (OA) implements the overlay the computers running
	a DiMaWo application are part of. In addition, the OA gives
	access to high-level services like broadcasting, leader
	election, barrier synchronization and failure detection (see
	{@link be.ulg.montefiore.dimawo.middleware.overlay overlay} package).</li>
	<li>The Shared-Map Agent (SMA) implements a shared map into which
	key-value pairs can be stored (see
	{@link be.ulg.montefiore.dimawo.middleware.sharedMap sharedMap} package).</li>
	<li>The File System Agent (FSA) implements a distributed file system
	that enables DiMaWo agents to easily share files. It directly relies
	on SMA to access its file table (see
	{@link be.ulg.montefiore.dimawo.middleware.fileSystem fileSystem} package).</li>
	<li>The Distributed Agent (DA) instantiates the WA and/or the MA provided
	by the user (see
	{@link be.ulg.montefiore.dimawo.middleware.distributedAgent distributedAgent} package).</li>
</ul>

<p>Each core agent is instantiated one time per computer running a DiMaWo
application's process. Each computer therefore also runs a WA and, if the
computer is the elected leader, the MA.</p>

<p>DiMaWo provides agents that implement a simple file transfer protocol that
uses DiMaWo's COM. In particular, these agents are used by the FSA. For more
details, see {@link be.ulg.montefiore.dimawo.fileTransfer fileTransfer}
package.</p>
